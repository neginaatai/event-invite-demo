***LearnerDashboard Research Dashboard***

AI/ML Research Dashboard is a fully deployed web application that fetches and displays the latest AI and Machine Learning research papers from arXiv. Users can search, filter, browse, and submit feedback on papers through a clean, interactive interface enhanced with icons. Built with Python Flask and deployed on Render, this project demonstrates full-stack development skills and real-world functionality suitable for internship portfolios.
